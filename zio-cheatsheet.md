The ZIO Cheatsheet
===================

# General considerations

## The language of ZIO
One of the key to master `ZIO` is to understand its language.

The essence of the API is to have a _few number of types_ (as few as possible and very well designed) with a LOT of combinators.
+ The combinators names between the types follow some conventions such as `map`, `flatMap`, `fold`, `zip` etc. 
+ The most commonly encountered combinators have _symbol_ aliases `flatMap` <=> `>>=`, `zip` <=> `<*>` etc.
+ when the combinator finish by `M` (ex: `fold` and `foldM`) it signals that the parameter is either and effect (`M` for Monad) or producing and effect and will `flatten` it.
+ The combinators bridge the type with the standard Scala API whenever possible (`Option`, `Either`, `Future`).  
+ The combinators try to give relations between types of the ZIO library when possible.

## Convention in this sheet
+ Effect of type ZIO are call `e`, `e1`, `e2`... 
+ Collection, noted `c` are taken in a broad sense when functions apply to them. They can be: `Option`, `Set`, `Chunk`, `Array`, `Collection <: Iterable`. This document just use the type `Collection` that do not exist per se but allows to write `Collection[A]` and intends all the concrete types cited above. 
+ Collection of effect (in the same sense than above) of effect are noted `ce`
+ function is noted `f`, `fm` (funtion the return effect)
+ duration is noted `d`
+ schedule is noted `s`
+ ZScope is noted `zs`
+ ZManaged is noted `zm`
+ ExecutionContext `ec`

# The `ZIO` type

The `ZIO[-R,+E,+A]` type is central to the whole API and is extremelly rich in combinators.

They have different purpose and can be roughly categorized as follows:
+ Interact with time/repetitions
+ Compose effect sequentially
+ Compose effect in parallel
+ Act on the error channel
+ Act on the environment channel
+ Async API
+ Provide managed resources (resource, cache, layer...)
